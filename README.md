#Birthday Countdown

Front-end assignment

Assignment: Build first personal project

    - Create new GitHub Repo

    - Build you idea and style from week 1 
        (or make a last minute change of style/idea. If you change your idea make a note in your project's README.md about what your new idea is and why you felt your new idea was a better choice). 
        
    - What is a suitable idea? Check the week 1 assignments or ask if you feel unsure.

    - Make sure there is some kind of interactivity on your site, i.e something that would require JavaScript on a regular HTML, CSS, js-site.

    - Make sure your choice of design style is well reflected on your site. Preferably "pixel perfect".

    - Give credit towards the style you picked. Somewhere on your site provide a mention and a link to where you found the style.

    - Use the build function in vite to make your site ready for production.

    - Publish your site. You can use GitHub pages or one of the other ways of publishing that I'll show this week (Netlify or Vercel).

    - Make sure to commit and push latest to GitHub repo.
